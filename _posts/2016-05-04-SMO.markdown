Here are some useful resources for implementing your own SMO.

[The original SMO paper][smo-book]

[A simplified version][smo-stanford]

I am not sure if my implementation is totally correct.
But I have tested it on some cases and it works fine.
The codes are arranged following the pseudo-codes provided by the original SMO paper.
